## What is Blockchain
   1) Blockchain is a digital, decentralized public ledger database where blocks are linked
   cryptographically, and transactions are digitally signed and managed using
   consensus model.

   2) Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording
   transactions and tracking assets in a business network

   3) Blockchain is Distributed, Immutable Ledger which is completely Transparent

   4) One key differnece between typical database and blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain collects data information in groups is called blocks 

   5) Blocks have certain storage capacities and when filled are closed and linked to previously filled block forming a chain of data is known as blockchain
    
   * As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.

## Variations of blockchain
   1) private blockchain- works on closed networks, permissioned settings that restrict who can operate on the chain, central authority manages the network, without an invitation or permission from the authority you cannot access the private blockchain

   2) Public blockchain- Home of significant crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, anyone can access the public blockchain because it is more open and decentralized, needs a large amount of processing power to keep the network efficient, pow

   3) Hybrid Blockchain: Similar to a private blockchain, this network is an open-source platform but controlled by a central entity. However, unlike other networks, there are no gatekeepers. Therefore, you can access the blockchain and make transactions without passing through the KYC requirements.

## Consortium Blockchain
   1) Business-focused consortium blockchain: Blockchain for particular business issues. The participants leverage each othersâ€™ strengths and pull their resources together, including finance, marketing strategy, research, and management, to achieve their individual and joint commercial goals.

   2) Technology-focused consortium blockchain: Technology-inclined companies can share resources and information on an efficient and reusable blockchain platform that focuses on a technicality.

   3) Dual-focused consortium blockchain: Dual-focused networks provides a platform that offers both technology and business solutions

   * Features Of Consortium Blockchain
     1) Partially Decentralized
     2) Privacy of Data
     3) More Controllable
     4) Faster Trnasction Speed
