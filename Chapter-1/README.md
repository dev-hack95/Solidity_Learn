## What is Blockchain
   1) Blockchain is a digital, decentralized public ledger database where blocks are linked
   cryptographically, and transactions are digitally signed and managed using
   consensus model.

   2) Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording
   transactions and tracking assets in a business network

   3) Blockchain is Distributed, Immutable Ledger which is completely Transparent

   4) One key differnece between typical database and blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain collects data information in groups is called blocks 

   5) Blocks have certain storage capacities and when filled are closed and linked to previously filled block forming a chain of data is known as blockchain
    
   * As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
