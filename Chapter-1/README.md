## What is Blockchain
   Blockchain is a digital, decentralized public ledger database where blocks are linked
   cryptographically, and transactions are digitally signed and managed using
   consensus model.

   Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording
   transactions and tracking assets in a business network

   Blockchain is Distributed, Immutable Ledger which is completely Transparent

   One key differnece between typical database and blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain collects data information in groups is called blocks 

   Blocks have certain storage capacities and when filled are closed and linked to previously filled block forming a chain of data is known as blockchain
